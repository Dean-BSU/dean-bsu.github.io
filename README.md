## About
### Who is Dean???
Hello, world!

I am Dean, a Software Development major at Boise State University. I've had an interest in software since 7th grade, and I have been developing in a variety of programming languages from Java to LUA since. Other than programming, I am an artist who designs a lot of character stickers.

My best work is the 24!Dragons Demo which was developed in Spring of 2024, it was a collaborative project between me and a friend. I'm hoping to make some even more impressive works going into 2025.

### What's the Data, Theta?
Current plans are to finish up some smaller projects like `Lighthouse` before moving on to my first large personal project 
*(besides Eg V'zar, but I'm not sure that counts...)*

## Projects History
*(Note: This section might be out of date! More thorough examples are listed on my portfolio site, which is currently not active.)*
### 24!Dragons
24!Dragons was my final graduation project of High School. Co-developed by Niky, the project featured an engine for a Vampire-Survivors-like game with 4 playable characters (24 total planned). I worked a lot on the project planning, gameplay elements, and sprites for the game! Nik did a lot of the backend and logistics, as well as researching the Godot engine, which we both had to learn.

### Pokemon Database
A database containing all the Pokemon, sortable and modifiable through a combination of PhP and MySQLi.
